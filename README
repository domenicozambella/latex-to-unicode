This is a small application which pops up a window where you can enter
some latex symbols and they are converted to unicode characters.

After pressing enter the unicode string is copied to the clipboard and
the window is destroyed.

This application is written in Python using tkinter.

Special thanks to Jos van den Oever, the author of unilatex.vim from
which I have the latex <-> unicode mapping.

Work in progress - it doesn't work yet.
